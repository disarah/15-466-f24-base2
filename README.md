# Raccoon of Doom

Author: Sarah Di (sarahdi)

Design: My game is based on the snake game but with a raccoon picking mushrooms.
One thing that is different from the original snake is that if you eat a red mushroom
the keypad direction will be disoriented.

How To Play:

WASD keys to control the raccoon. Collect mushrooms.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
